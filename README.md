## Overview
This is a PyTorch project that implements a minimalistic U-Mamba architecture [described here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.04722.pdf). 

The model is a replacement for convolutional-based image segmentation models based on state spaces.

For more details architecture, refer to the original paper: [U-Mamba: Enhancing Long-range Dependency for Biomedical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.04722.pdf).

## Setup

To get started with Transformer Plain, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/paulilioaica/U-Mamba-Pytorch
    cd U-Mamba-Pytorch/src/
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
